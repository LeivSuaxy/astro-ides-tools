**Docker** is a platform designed to help developers build, deploy, and run applications inside **containers**. Containers allow for consistent environments across different stages of development and production, ensuring that applications run the same regardless of where they are deployed. This helps in **isolating applications** from their underlying infrastructure, making them more **portable** and **scalable**. Docker also provides tools for **orchestration**, **networking**, and **storage**, making it a comprehensive solution for modern application development.
