**Django** is a **high-level Python web framework** that allows developers to build robust and scalable web applications quickly. It follows the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architectural pattern, which promotes the separation of concerns and enhances code maintainability.

One of Django's key features is its **built-in admin interface**, which provides a powerful and customizable interface for managing application data. Additionally, Django includes a wide range of **built-in tools and libraries**, such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, form handling, authentication, and more.

Django emphasizes **reusability and "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principles**, making it easier to write clean and efficient code. It also has a strong focus on **security**, with features like protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.

With its **comprehensive documentation** and a large, active community, Django is an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers looking to build web applications with Python.
