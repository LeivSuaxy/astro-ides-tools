**FastAPI** is a **web framework** for building **APIs** with **Python**. It is designed to be **fast** and **efficient**, leveraging **Python 3.6+** type hints to provide **automatic validation** and **serialization**. FastAPI is built on **Starlette** for the web parts and **Pydantic** for the data parts. It includes features such as **asynchronous request handling**, **dependency injection**, and **automatic interactive API documentation** with **Swagger** and **ReDoc**. This makes it an excellent choice for creating **high-performance** and **easy-to-maintain** APIs.
